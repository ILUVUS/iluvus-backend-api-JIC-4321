### Description

We're working on a social media app called ILUVUS, which focuses on celebrating racial minorities and marginalized communities like the LGBTQ+. Our goal is to connect these diverse communities in a world where discrimination and intolerance are still prevalent. ILUVUS aims to address this issue by promoting positivity, celebrating achievements, and combatting discrimination.

We're developing our own platform instead of using existing ones because they don't prioritize the celebration and recognition of these communities' accomplishments. Our focus is on offering a unique user experience that celebrates diversity. By doing this, we can ensure strict moderation of hateful posts and messages and promote positivity effectively.

## Getting Started

### Technology Stack:

-   **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework for building robust and scalable backend applications.

-   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Google Cloud Run for deploying and running containerized applications.

-   **Google Cloud Storage**: A scalable and secure object storage solution provided by Google Cloud Platform.

-   **GitHub Actions**: GitHub's built-in CI/CD solution for automating workflows, including building, testing, and deploying applications.

### Dependencies

-   Maven

-   Generally, use the following [link](https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac) to install maven on your system.

-   For Mac OS: [Instruction](https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-to-Setup-Maven-for-Mac-OS)

-   For Windows: [Instruction](https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/)

-   JDK 8+

-   Use this link [https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) to download and install OpenJDK version that is compatible with your Operation System.

### Installing & Execute

1. Use the following link to install maven on your system.

[https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac](https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac)

-   For Mac OS: [Instruction](https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-to-Setup-Maven-for-Mac-OS)

-   For Windows: [Instruction](https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/)

2. Clone the ILUVUS Backend API Repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/ILUVUS/iluvus-backend-api-JIA-3317.git

```

3. Create `application.properties` in `/src/main/resources`. Modify the following content:

```java
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<USERNAME:<PASSWORD>@iluvusdb.mocs11o.mongodb.net/iluvus
spring.data.mongodb.database=iluvus
iluvus.email.passwordtoken=<GMAIL_GENERATED_PASSWORD>
```

Modify `<USERNAME>` and `<PASSWORD>` with provided information.

4. Go to the repository directory on your Operation System. Run SpringBoot:

```bash

mvn spring-boot:run

```

4. Check the API with your browser: [127.0.0.1/8080](127.0.0.1/8080)

5. Your browser should return: `Welcome to ILUVUS. API is running well!`

### Deployment on Google Cloud

1. [Create a new Google Cloud Project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project)

2. [Create an Artifact Registry Repository](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repositories/create-repos)

    - Name the Repo "iluvus", all lowercase
    - Make sure the repo is created under the same service account

3. [Create a Cloud Run Service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying)

    - Make sure the service is created under the same service account

4. Locate to GCP Dashboard, use this to replace the `PROJECT_ID` on Github Secrets.

5. Locate to GCP Cloud Run Dashboard, copy the Service Name and use this to replace `PROJECT_SERVICE` on Github Secrets.

<img src='./img/gcp/cloudrun.png' width=700 />

6. [Create a Google Service Account Credential](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_credentials_for_a_service_account)

    - Copy the content of the JSON file obtained from the step 5 above. Use the content to replace the `GG_CREDENTIAL` on Github Secrets.

7. Create APPCONFIG

Modify the following content:

```java
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<USERNAME:<PASSWORD>@iluvusdb.mocs11o.mongodb.net/iluvus
spring.data.mongodb.database=iluvus
iluvus.email.passwordtoken=<GMAIL_GENERATED_PASSWORD>
```

Modify `<USERNAME>` and `<PASSWORD>` with provided information.

8. Use the APPCONFIG Content to replace the APPCONFIG on Github Secrets.

After all, the Github Secrets should map with the above steps like below:
